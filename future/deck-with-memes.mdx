> "Did you call the right service?"

‚Äì Colleagues

# Services?

- A modern app is devided into multiple logical services.
- These services expose APIs for interaction with other services or Apps.
- In context of this talk APIs refer to Rest APIs served over HTTP

---

### More precisely these...

![](images/services.jpg)

# How to use a service?

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li> Get the URL of service </li>
		<li> Call with correct method (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> etc.)</li>
		<li> Use correct <code>Content-Type</code> and other request headers.</li>
		<li>...and don't forget correct payload</li>
		<li>Hmm, one last thing, some URLs may contain query parameters. They are very important.</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

# Few JIRA's later
## Checklist continues

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>If something is wrong services response contains error message.</li>
		<li>Services might have different error message data structure.</li>
		<li>If service is unavailable or server throws, you might not get response in expected content type, so handle that as well, Please.</li>
	</Appear>

# Colleagues are great

- I've been encouraged to read sourcecode of various services.
- I've been informed about any changes in API.
- I've been coached with methods to investigate and debug the issues.
- Even they sometime handle frontend issues only to realise halfway that it's frontend issue. 

### Have you got one to cover you?

---

# Not everyone is that lucky...
For you there are other ways to describe APIs

- [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)
- [API Doc](http://apidocjs.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)
- [RESTful API Modeling Language](https://raml.org/)
- [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)
- [Open API Specification](https://www.openapis.org) F.K.A. Swagger Specification

---

# What is Open API?

Programming language-agnostic specification standard to govern how REST APIs are described.

---

# Features

- Helps you describe REST APIs in texual format (JSON, yaml)
- Difinition files can be written by hand or auto generated
- These API definitions can be consumed by Humans and Machines alike
- Tooling can generate API documentation and mocks
- In active development and adopted by all the big players in industry

---

# Tooling

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a set of tooling which helps generating Open API specification.
- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) Auto generate server stubs and client SDKs for any API
- [Swagger Editor](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/) Design, describe, and document your API
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) visualize and interact with the API‚Äôs resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

---

# Premium tooling
- [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/) The Platform for API Design and Documentation with OpenAPI
- [Swagger Inspector](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-inspector/) Test and document APIs

---

# Benefits

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
	<Appear>
		<li>Improve collaboration between service provider and consumer</li>
		<li>Improve discoverability of services (for humans and machines)</li>
		<li>Promote predictable service usage</li>
		<li>Early feedback during development life cycle</li>
		<li>Help in spoting integration bugs / issues early and easily</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>
