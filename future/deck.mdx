# Goal

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
	<Appear>
		<li>Improve collaboration between service provider and consumer</li>
		<li>Improve discoverability of services (for humans and machines)</li>
		<li>Promote predictable service usage</li>
		<li>Early feedback during development life cycle</li>
		<li>Spot integration bugs / issues early and easily</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
No need to run an app and check if it works, inspect request / response / payload

Not a la Kubernetes service discovery
Developer of consumer app may refer to service catalog to find -
	- what service to use and when
	- understand and develop for different request / response shape

Express and agree on the Request / Response / payload before developing and changing implementation
No need to read and able to understand source code
Don't wonder if mock data is outdated
Easier upgrade and broadcast of caution in case of upgrade

A design first approach can give early feedback about viability of implementation.
	- You may find edge cases
	- This style of implementation promotes optimization for consumer.
	- A service not optimised for consumption should revisit it's purpose of existance.

Trivial to write tests and integration issues
If a service doesn't behave as per specs, it's a bug.

### What is Open API?

Standard specification to govern how REST APIs are described.

---

# Little bit of History

A brief introduction of [HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) based 
[RESTful services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

```notes
One doesn't need to know Open API if not using REST.
A brief introduction of REST is required for passive users.
```
---

# REpresentational State Transfer

REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access 
and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a 
uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

---

# Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
   level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
   systems.

---
> "The World Wide Web" is built on HTTP protocol and by default based on RESTful architecture.
---
# What does that mean?
---
## A typical webpage is a HTML document composed of various independent web resources.
Such as -
<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>Images / Video / Audio</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Scripts</li>
		<li>Fonts</li>
		<li>... and many more</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>
---
# Web resources
- Have URL
- Stateless
- Cacheable
- Response === URL + Request headers + HTTP Verb

---
```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```

# The end
